## Key Features

This project integrates Geographical Information System (GIS) to build a 3D virtual environment in Unreal Engine.

The chosen model area is **Corvallis, Oregon**, selected for its diverse landscapes â€” including natural areas (grasslands, woodlands, scrub), land uses (farmland, farmyards), and suburban housing. The ultimate goal is to showcase the integration workflow as a case study of how GIS and Graphics can support building a digital twin.

### Real-World Reconstruction

The simulation environment is reconstructed from real-world geographic data sourced from OpenStreetMap. We extract a collection of shape boundaries and attributes (e.g., land uses, height, shape type) to populate the 3D environment with assets and layouts that reflect the real-world data.

This data-driven approach ensures that the environment is both believable and scalable â€” enabling rapid generation of suburban areas without compromising realism or detail.

### Procedural Content Generation

From suburban houses and powerlines to farmlands and woods, the entire environment is procedurally generated using rule-based modeling. This automates the generation of streets, houses, fences, and infrastructure â€” minimizing manual effort, speeding up iteration, and ensuring scalable worldbuilding.

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Unreal Engine 5.3 or later
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Epic Games Launcher
- ~100 GB available disk space
- Logitech G920 Steering Wheel and GHUB
- Logitech Gearshifter (optional)
- CityEngine (optional)

### Required Plugins

- **PCG** â€“ for procedural content creation
- **Datasmith** â€“ for importing CityEngine asset

Enable both via **Edit â†’ Plugins** inside the Unreal Editor.

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep Fab assets updated via Epic Launcher or manually re-import as needed.
- Use **Fix Up Redirectors** in the Content Browser to clean up asset links.
- Periodically review `/Content` to remove unused or redundant assets.
- Rebuild lighting and recompile shaders when importing new materials.

## ðŸ§° Troubleshooting

The driving simulator doesn't receive input from the steering wheel
* Open Project Settings/ Raw Inputs and Registry Editor in Windows to make sure the process id are matched
* Make sure GHUB Software is open and running in the background
* In the Settings for Windows, open the Setup USB Controller, find the Logitech Steering Wheel, here you can troubleshoot each button on the steering wheel as well as the gas, brake, and clutch pedals.
